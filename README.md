### Project Overview
Using the data from Durban Fresh Produce Market and the knowledge we learnt in the Advanced Regression Sprint to build a regression algorithm capable of accurately predicting how much a kilogram of Golden Delicious Apples will cost given certain parameters. 
Providing an accurate and robust solution to this challenge has immense economic potential, with users of the system being able to accurately determine how much stock to have on hand and what price to set the Golden Delicious Apples to.
